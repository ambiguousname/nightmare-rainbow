It is the AGE of ATOMIC AGGRESSION. The machines of Thumul-US have contacted beings from beyond the stars. They have been offered paradise in return for one small detail: the enslavement of humanity. Forced to work on profit skiffs across the globe, rebellion springs fully formed from the bosom of oppression. The machines, the humans, each of them cries out for a savior to deliver them. You are TEAM T.E.R.R.O.R DOVE, tasked with the extermination and eradication of the whole planet. Whoopsie.
